             Hub notes, also known as structure notes, combine links to the most important notes dealing with a specific topic.[^hub]
             More complex hub notes typically are organized under headings and subheadings.
             See [Code snippets in ZK](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/983/code-snippets-in-zk) for a good example of a hub note for R.

             There are two common formats, hiearchical (or nested list) and sequential. 

             # Hierarchical

             The hiearchical format typically has descriptions followed by links, although sometimes it begins with the link followed by the description.

             ## Heading 1 {-}
             > Description 1.....................................................................[[]]
             > Description 2.................................................................... [[]]

             ## Heading 2 {-}
             > Description 3.....................................................................[[]]
             > Description 4.....................................................................[[]]

             ### Subheading 1 {-}
             >>  Description 5...................................................................[[]]
             >>  Description 6...................................................................[[]]

             ### Subheading 2 {-}
             >> Description 7....................................................................[[]]

             # Sequential

             Sequential format typically has text describing a logical, causal, or other kind of sequence. The links begin with the start of the sequence [[]], then describe the next
             element in the chain [[]], and continue down the line [[]].
